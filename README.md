# ðŸ‘‹Hey there, Iâ€™m Orlando.
My journey as a Full Stack Developer began in 2021 when I wrote my first "Hello World!" in an HTML file, and that is one of the best things that could have happened to me. 

___

## ðŸ‘½What I do
- I **_develop_** both personal and external web projects that enable me to continuously improve my skills as a **_full stack developer_**.

- I **_learn_** new **_languages_** and **_technologies_** and implement them into the projects I work with, preparing myself for the next steps in this development environment.

___

## ðŸŽ¯Objectives
One of my objectives is to make a **_lasting impact in the world_**, one that can help to develop a brighter future.
To accomplish this, I firmly believe that continuous personal growth and development are essential. 
This drives me to consistently **_seek new opportunities_** that can provide meaningful experiences and foster my growth.

In addition to that, I am really interested in developing myself as a **_team leade_r**. 
I aspire to guide and inspire a team towards optimal results while fostering a strong, united, and capable group.
