# 👋Hey there, I’m Orlando.
My journey as a Full Stack Developer began in 2021 when I wrote my first "Hello World!" in an HTML file, and that is one of the best things that could have happened to me. 

___

## 💻What I do
I **_develop_** both personal and external projects that allow me to continuously improve my skills as a **_full stack developer_**.

Additionally, I am learning new **_languages_** and **_technologies_**, implementing them into these projects to be prepared for the next steps in this development environment.

___

## 🏁Objectives
One of my objectives is to make a **_lasting impact in the world_**, one that can help to develop a brighter future.
To accomplish this, I firmly believe that continuous personal growth and development are essential. 
This drives me to consistently **_seek new opportunities_** that can provide meaningful experiences and foster my growth.

In addition to that, I am really interested in developing myself as a **_team leade_r**. 
I aspire to guide and inspire a team towards optimal results while fostering a strong, united, and capable group.
