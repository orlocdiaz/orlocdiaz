# 👋Hey there, I’m Orlando.
My journey as a Full Stack Developer began in 2021 when I wrote my first "Hello World!" in an HTML file, and that is one of the best things that could have happened to me. 

___

## 💻What I do
I develop both personal and external projects that allow me to continuously improve my skills as a full stack developer.

Additionally, I am learning new languages and technologies, implementing them into these projects to be prepared for the next steps in this development environment.

___

## 🏁Objectives
One of my objectives is to make a lasting impact in the world, one that can help to develop a brighter future.
To accomplish this, I firmly believe that continuous personal growth and development are essential. 
This drives me to consistently seek new opportunities that can provide meaningful experiences and foster my growth.

In addition to that, I am really interested in developing myself as a team leader. 
I aspire to guide and inspire a team towards optimal results while fostering a strong, united, and capable group.
